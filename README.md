# logtime
Calculate simulation performance from GROMACS logfiles by parsing checkpoint timestamps.

Mostly an exercise in parsing and making (too elaborate) classes.

## Usage
`logtime [logfile]`

The buffer that it reads can not be adjusted for now as well as the number of samples it tries to read.
